- Universe of different sizes could be tested
- Other patterns should be added
- What if a pattern does not fit in the universe?

- We have created units that add a pattern to the universe. These units need to be tested seperately. Also, we can add additional functionalities to handle cases for when the pattern does not fit in a small universe.

- We can add functionality that uses the OpenAPI definition to generate the model etc. Instead of doing this by hand EVERY SINGLE TIME.
